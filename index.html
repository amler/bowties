		<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<p>
			R. Hanauer was established in 1986 when its owner, Randy Hanauer, realized that white pocket squares were a niche that needed to be filled in the menswear market. At that time, the only squares available were the “for blow, not for show” type, and, as Hanauer knew, a handkerchief is much too large for a suit breast pocket. Hanauer’s knowledge in fabric, design and color, combined with his experience as a manufacturers’ representative made his new business endeavor possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hanauer’s first pocket squares were designed by Hanauer, then cut, sewn and pressed with the aid of a seamstress, on a single machine which could perform a simulated hand rolled edge on the squares. Much of the pressing and packaging took place on his dining room table. He later found a tailor shop in Rock Hill, South Carolina, that would produce his products.
		</p>
		<p>
			The squares were well received by the retail stores. Hanauer soon added a few new patterns, such as tattersalls, plaids and paisleys. As he grew in talent and confidence, bow ties and matching cummerbunds were added to his product line.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1990, R. Hanauer, Inc. expanded operations as the company moved into its own workshop in Fort Mill, South Carolina. The company has since tripled the size of the facility. R. Hanauer products are proudly made in the USA from imported fabrics, and Hanauer attributes much of his success to, “good honest working relationships and a product based on quality.”
