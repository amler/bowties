##Getting Started


In order to compile this project's files you will need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) (the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) package manager), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). With that in mind, follow the following steps:

1. Install npm by downloading and installing the appropriate package from [Node.js's website](http://nodejs.org/download/).
2. Install Grunt by running `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli` or by following
[Grunt's installation instructions](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).
3. Install Sass by running `sudo gem install sass` or by following [Sass's installation instructions](http://sass-lang.com/install).
4. After cloning the project's Git repository, run `npm install` on the cloned directory to install all of the project's Grunt dependencies.
5. Run `grunt watch` to confirm that you can successfully compile the project's Sass and Javascript files.
